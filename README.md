# E-commerce Recommender System using PCA and K-Means Clustering
We propose an e-commerce product recommendation system based on Collaborative Filtering using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means Clustering. K-Means is used to overcome sparsity problems and to form user clusters
to reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed. While PCA is used to reduce data dimensions and improve clustering
performance of K-Means. The test results using the sports product dataset on the Olist e-commerce show that the proposed
system has a lower RMSE value compared to other methods.
